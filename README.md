## **Description**
For this project I was to create a website to feature my portfolio, a little about me and a way to contact me. I started by created files for each of the pages and the css file. I used getbootstrap.com for components across all the pages such as a navbar. I then used other elements such as a card and a form on my contact and portfolio pages. The most complicated part was trying to figure out how to correct the viewfinder appearance when resizing.
